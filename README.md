### About The Project

The idea for the project Papinhas Boas (roughly translated to Good Foods) came as a fusion between two concepts: the demand from our family and friends for us to create a way to for them to keep up to date with our gastronomic adventures; and my interest in learning React.js in the context of the MERN stack (Mongo.db, Express.js, React.js and Node.js).

The application has three main features:

- Restaurant list: list with all of our favorite restaurants with a gallery of photos taken by us, price range, score, last visit and a button that redirects the user to restaraunt's location on a map.
- Map view: world map view marked with every single restaurant listed (using Google's React Map component).
- Newsletter subscription: allows visitors to sign-up to our newsletter with updates (using Mailchimp).

There is also an About Us section to let people know a little more about us.
